        "q": "Theatre has long held a vital place in African society, particularly in traditional times when it was deeply cherished by communities. Its popularity stemmed from its communal nature, serving as a mirror that reflected the common concerns of the people—touching on political, social, and economic issues that mattered to everyday life. Far from being just a source of amusement, theatre was a shared experience that united people and gave voice to their collective struggles and aspirations. In modern Africa, however, theatre’s appeal has waned significantly. Many now regard it as not being of much use, overshadowed by other forms of entertainment and education that seem more relevant to contemporary needs. A key reason for this decline lies with academic playwrights, who often express themselves only in foreign languages, such as English or French, rather than local tongues. This choice alienates the common man, making theatre feel distant and inaccessible. Critics argue that to revive its relevance, modern playwrights must 'climb down' from their lofty academic positions—meaning they should adopt a simpler, more relatable use of language that resonates with the broader population. Throughout this discussion, the terms 'theatre' and 'drama' are used interchangeably, reflecting their synonymous application in the context of African cultural expression.

        "q": "Universities play a crucial role in society, and their ability to operate independently is essential for their growth and development. This independence is vital so that they can expand without hindrances, free from excessive external control or interference. However, achieving such autonomy is closely tied to how universities are funded. Historically, the government has been the primary source of university funding, providing the bulk of financial support for infrastructure, research, and operations. Yet, this heavy reliance on government resources can limit a university’s freedom to set its own goals and priorities. To address this, the writer advocates for diversified funding sources—widening the pool beyond just government support. By incorporating contributions from industries, the general public, and even students, universities can enhance their autonomy, reducing their dependence on a single entity. This approach ensures they can tackle the intricate issues of special concern—complex matters requiring careful thought, such as academic innovation and societal impact—without being beholden to governmental agendas. Diversifying funding not only strengthens financial stability but also empowers universities to chart their own course in an ever-evolving world.
